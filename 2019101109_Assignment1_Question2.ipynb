Which is actually much larger than my RAM. So, I used CSR_matrix to generate tha sparse natrix of the data we have(User Vs all unique Posts). Used TruncatedSVD to reduce the dimensionality o the matrix. Which made me to use the Faiss. Faiss is implemented by Facebook for efficient similarity search between multimedia documents. It is very efficient working with millons to even billions of datasets for similarity search ver efficiently.*"
